 *         the list.  Note that the server may clean up contacts, and that this cleanup
 *         occurs before checking for duplication.  Receiving this error is commonly
 *         an indication of a client issue, since client should be normalizing contacts
 *         and removing duplicates. All instances that are duplicates are returned.  For
 *         example, if a list of 5 contacts has the same e-mail address twice, the two
